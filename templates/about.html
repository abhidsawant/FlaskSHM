    <h1>About Our Project</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to our Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system for Bridge Fault Detection. Our project focuses on ensuring the safety and longevity of bridges by leveraging modern technology to detect faults and structural anomalies in real time.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        Our mission is to create a reliable and efficient monitoring system that uses data-driven insights to identify potential bridge faults before they become critical. By integrating machine learning models with real-world data, we aim to support proactive maintenance strategies for infrastructure safety.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gathering data from government sources and other reliable platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning Models:</strong> Utilizing trained TensorFlow models to analyze patterns and detect faults.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time Monitoring:</strong> Displaying results via a user-friendly Streamlit interface integrated with Flask.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Team</h2>
    <p>
        We are a team of passionate developers and engineers dedicated to using technology for public safety. Our project combines software engineering, data science, and cloud integration to build a scalable solution.
